    Hi and welcome to the official ModZ Wiki. My name is Micha aka Globox, I´m a mechanical engineer student from
    Germany. I don´t know how, but I just got interested in coding, especially in minecraft modding. I have decided to
    join the fabric community and write my mods with the fabric toolchain because when I first got interested in it,
    there weren´t mods for the newest Minecraft version and at the same time a playable optifine version except for the
    fabric modlauncher. I have been playing Minecraft for a while (probably spent too much lifetime in it xD), which is
    how I get my ideas for these mods. As time goes on I keep expanding, adding things that I either feel the game
    needs or I just want. I plan to keep developing these mods as well as do my best to keep up with vanilla releases.
    For you to know, this wiki is only for the newest version of my mods
