    Just a simple message I wanna tell you

  <p id="text">
    Hey you, who this is reading right now, I make it clear at the beginning: I belief and stay 100% behind this message
    that "you are loved". Regardless of, if you have loved ones, a family, a partner or friends who love you, (don't
    miss understand me, those are all great people and you can be thankful for them if you have em) but I believe you
    are much more loved even without these persons, more on that later. <br><br>

    First I think we should get to know each other a little better (or at least you get to know me better and get a
    better picture of me, cause I write some characteristics about me, when reading further this text). My name is Micha
    (no that is not a shortening for Michael ^^), I am 24 years old (while I'm writing this) and I study mechanical
    engineering. I would say I am an average person, not super intelligent, eat sometimes healthy sometimes not, do some
    sports and depending on the situation a little more extroverted or introverted. I love to hang out with friends,
    also like to code and do other stuff in my free time. <br><br>

    After living on this ball called planet earth about 24 years I learned a few things in life. Of course there are
    many people who have far more experience and are much wiser in life than me but I will share in the following
    sentences the most important lesson I learned here. Of course it has something to do with the meaning of life
    (otherwise it would not be number #1) and with belief. Most of the (about 8 billion) people around the world deal
    with the topic "meaning of life" in their lifetime which is a good thing (everybody should at least do it but
    probably everybody does it somehow) and they figure out different things for them. <br><br>

    Lets stop here for a bit .. Everybody beliefs in something, even if it is in "nothing". There are a couple of
    different Gods in different religions and I think it is interesting how those different beliefs represent the story
    of life (Btw I am not a fan of religion since for me, heavily broken down it is just following specific rules to
    archive something like getting to heaven). The most known theory of life is the big bang theory where out of nothing
    an "explosion" happened and out of this bang the universe got created. Some say a being (some call it God) has done
    this in this theory, much to high for my brain to take honestly. I mean our brains are more than super computers,
    definitely a masterpiece but I definitely see some limitations given for it (of course I appreciate I have one) like
    not being able to imagine this something called "nothing" inside the big bang theory and how something can come from
    nothing. I myself believe in something behind of what I see (I mean behind life). For me it makes sense that there
    has to be more, more than just being alive here for a limited amount of time and depending on luck, life is better
    or worse in comparison to other lives (Depends strongly on the life perspective). Why? Cause I experienced it &lt;-
    this sounds kinda odd xD However I belief in something (lets call it God out of convenience) and even if you don't
    believe in the same thing, don't worry of course we could be friends. But since it has something to do with number
    #1, what I want to share is, a little further down this text. <br><br>

    Every single human on this ball has a different view
    on things because we are raised and taught differently during our lifetimes. The result is, we have our own ways
    to think about and see stuff around us. Of course many things overlap but all in all it will always be a little
    different to others. I for example look at the world (or at least a couple of things) with a view of an engineer,
    like how long can this tire last or how resistant is this glass. And that is one reason why the world is not a
    boring place and the reason why every human perceive situations differently. It is also the reason why everybody
    has a different image of God (if they have one). However my biggest wish in life is, every human on this ball should
    experience this God in a way. I even belief this God wants to live with its creatures (who we are) and even wants
    these creatures to get to know him better (can also be "her" but it is just convenience). People could ask me why
    I think this God wants to live with us and even have some kind of relationship? The answer is, I experienced this
    God like that. Of course I could be dumb and this is all imagination but let me tell you this, you have never felt
    and experienced him then. <br><br>

    I realized regardless of what I do, if I turn my back to him or try to be as close as
    possible to him, this God wants a relationship with me. What I encourage you to is to ask your God (if you have
    one, if not just ask in an empty room) to reveal him for you and watch out for it. One of the biggest issues is,
    we humans or at least I can fill my day and thoughts easily with many things and lose my focus on what I really
    want and what I am really looking for. <br><br>

    Back to number #1. Since I belief in this God, I think the meaning of life
    is to grow in a wise way and get to know this God better. That's it. Basically. Why? Because as the creator of me,
    he knows what's best for me. Better than I do. So it is a wise thing, to be in close contact to him and learn from
    him. Yes this includes all life struggles and phases, regardless if they are in my eyes good or bad, I learn from
    it and hang out with this God, talk with him and try to listen to him. And from my experience, this whole story
    leads to JESUS. <br><br>
