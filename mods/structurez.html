  </div>
  <p class="texts textdistance">
    This observation tower has had its best days a long time ago. It was very useful to see an attacker at a long
    distance to save time so you could prepare your village for a fight or maybe even a war?

  <div>

  <p class="texts textdistance">
    King of the sea is his title. he was such a powerful king that he ruled over all the oceans but he was sadly
    addicted to gold and all that glittered. To protect it from thieves, he hid all his treasures but maybe you can find
    some of it in the sea?

    Flooded in the sea, this tower is now ruled by sea creatures. It's gonna be very hard to take it back
  </p>
  <div>
    <img class="normalpictures" src="../images/screenshots/structureisland.png" alt="Floating Island">
  </div>
  <p class="texts textdistance">
    On a long journey a villager discovered this floating island. He decided to look who is actually living in such a
    home but when he got to this place, there was nobody there! Since there is enough space for everything necessary, he
    just stayed there until this day. Pay him a visit and give him my regards. By the way, how did he got up to this
    island?
