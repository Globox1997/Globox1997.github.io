    AppleZ adds mainly new types of apples to Minecraft. Every vanilla tree drops a different apple and they
    have different effects when you eat them. For example the regeneration apple grants you, as the name suggests,
    the regeneration effect.

    Other things like pies and a little bit of random apple related things coming also with this mod. Dry a normal
    apple at the fire camp (or just put it in the furnace.. however) to get a dried apple (itÂ´s a little bit more
    nutritious)
    and craft it to yummy apple crisps. You could also make some apple juice and from time to time, the leaves will drop
    some single leaves which will boost you for a short period of time (just hold right click)

    To preserve the apples, which will make them more powerfull and always edible, you have to get preservation sugar
    which is shown here. For all other recipes, I recommend to install the mod <a class="classiclink"
